# Visual Bubble Sort
This project was inspired by a very famous video that demonstrated visually how different sorting algorithms work. After watching this I decided to implement the humble [Bubble Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm in C++ using SFML to produce the visuals. I originally intended to use [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) but decided to switch to Bubble Sort part way through as i found it easier to implement and I didn't want to spend too much time on this project. Overall I'm very pleased with how this turned out and would encourage others to do the same. Below I've included a link to the inspiration of this project.
